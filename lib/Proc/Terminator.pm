=head1 NAME

Proc::Terminator - Conveniently terminate processes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Proc::Terminator;
    
    # Try and kill $pid using various methods, waiting
    # up to 20 seconds
    
    proc_terminate($pid, max_wait => 20);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Proc::Terminator> provides a convenient way to kill a process, often useful in
utility and startup functions which need to ensure the death of an external
process.

This module provides a simple, blocking, and procedural interface to kill
a process or multiple processes (not tested), and not return until they are
all dead.

C<Proc::Terminator> can know if you do not have permissions to kill a process,
if the process is dead, and other interesting tidbits.

It also provides for flexible options in the type of death a process will
experience. Whether it be slow or immediate.

This module exports a single function, C<proc_terminate>

=head2 C<proc_terminate($pids, %options)>

Will try to terminate C<$pid>, waiting until the process is no longer alive, or
until a fatal error happens (such as a permissions issue).

C<$pid> can either be a single PID (a scalar), or a reference to an array of
I<multiple> PIDs, in which case they are all attempted to be killed, and the
function only returning once all of them are dead (or when no possible kill
alternatives remain).

The C<%options> is a hash of options which control the behavior for trying to
terminate the pid(s).

=over

=item C<max_wait>

Specify the time (in seconds) that the function should try to spend killing the
provided PIDs. The function is guaranteed to not wait longer than C<max_wait>.

This parameter can also be a fractional value (and is passed to L<Time::HiRes>).

I<DEFAULT>: 10 Seconds.

=item C<siglist>

An array of signal constants (use L<POSIX>'s C<:signal_h> to get them).

The signals are tried in order, until there are no more signals remaining.

Sometimes applications do proper cleanup on exit with a 'proper' signal such as
C<SIGINT>.

The default value for this parameter

The default signal list can be found in C<@Proc::Terminator::DefaultSignalOrder>

I<DEFAULT>: C<[SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL]>

=item C<grace_period>

This specifies a time, in seconds, between the shifting of each signal in the
C<siglist> parameter above.

In other words, C<proc_terminate> will wait C<$grace_period> seconds after sending
each signal in C<siglist>. Thereafter the signal is removed, and the next signal
is attempted.

Currently, if you wish to have controlled signal wait times, you can simply
insert a signal more than once into C<siglist>

I<DEFAULT>: 0.75

=item C<interval>

This is the loop interval. The loop will sleep for ever C<interval> seconds.
You probably shouldn't need to modify this

I<DEFAULT>: 0.25

=back

When called in a scalar context, returns true on success, and false otherwise.

When called in list context, returns a list of the PIDS B<NOT> killed.

=head2 OO Interface

This exists mainly to provide compatibility for event loops. While C<proc_terminate>
loops internally, event loops will generally have timer functions which will
call within a given interval.

In the OO interface, one instantiates a C<Proc::Terminator::Batch> object which
contains information about the PIDs the user wishes to kill, as well as the signal
list (in fact, C<proc_terminate> is a wrapper around this interface)

=head3 Proc::Terminator::Batch methods

=head4 Proc::Terminator::Batch->with_pids($pids,$options)

Creates a new C<Proc::Terminator::Batch>. The arguments are exactly the same as
that for L</proc_terminate>.

Since this module does not actually loop or sleep on anything, it is important
to ensure that the C<grace_period> and C<max_wait> options are set appropriately.

In a traditional scenario, a timer would be associated with this object which would
fire every C<grace_period> seconds.

=head4 $batch->loop_once()

Iterates once over all remaining processes which have not yet been killed, and try
to kill them.

Returns a true value if processes still remain which may be killed, and a false
value if there is nothing else to do for this batch.

More specifically, if all processes have been killed successfully, this function
returns C<0>. If there are still processes which are alive (but cannot be killed
due to the signal stack being empty, or another error), then C<undef> is returned.

=head4 $batch->badprocs

Returns a reference to an array of C<Proc::Terminator::Ctx> objects which were
not successfully terminated. The Ctx object is a simple container. Its API fields
are as follows:

=over

=item pid

The numeric PID of the process

=item siglist

A reference to an array of remaining signals which would have been sent to this
process

=item error

This is the captured value of C<$!> at the time the error occurred (if any). If this
is empty, then most likely the process did not respond to any signals in the
signal list.
